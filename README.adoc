= Spring Boot Multiple DataSource Sample

This sample application shows how to configure multiple `DataSource` beans in a Spring Boot based application while still using the familiar configuration properties to customize their settings.

The configuration in this sample is based on the approach outlined in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto.data-access.configure-two-datasources[_Configure Two DataSources_ section] of Spring Boot's reference manual.
